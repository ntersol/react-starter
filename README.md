# React Starter app

This application is a series of demos of various features of React that can help jump start an application. One can pick and choose from the features list for your apps needs.

Would you really bootstrap a new client app with this code? Probably not, you'd run [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) so you can customize it according to the needs from the get-go.

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites

- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Install the Node Version given in the `.nvmrc` file.

### `nvm use`

Chooses the version of node specified in the `.nvmrc`

### `yarn`

Installs packages.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

One of the great things about a bundled build is you can host it on a simple AWS S3 bucket
(or the equivalents for Azure, GCP). Saves you money on standing up a Linux server
on EC2 etc.

## Linting Setup

These packages are added to `devDependencies`:

> eslint, eslint-config-standard, eslint-config-standard-jsx,
> eslint-config-standard-react, eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-json, eslint-plugin-n, eslint-plugin-node, eslint-plugin-promise, eslint-plugin-react, prettier

### Linting IDE Setup: Webstorm

1. Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> Code Quality Tools -> ESLint
2. Selecting the `Automatic ESLing Configuration` radio button should be sufficient
3. Check the box if you want ESLint fixing on save

If you would like a keystroke to fire off your ESLint fixing:

1. Preferences -> Keymap -> Plugins -> Javascript and TypeScript, double-click on item "Fix ESLint Problems", select "Add Keyboard Shortcut" and type in your shortcut. Mine is ctrl-Shift-L.

### Linting IDE Setup: VSCode

> The instructions below are incomplete and need to be improved by
> someone who knows VSCode well.

1. In the left rail, click the Extensions icon
2. In the search field, type eslint. The `ESLint` extension should come up. If not installed, press the blue `Install` button
3. Open VSCode settings (cmd-comma on a Mac). It the left rail, Open `Extensions` and click on _ESLint_.
4. Press the checkbox under `Eslint: Enable`
5. Under `Eslint: Run` select the _onSave_ option.

## React App anatomy

The sequence of events when you launch the app with `npm run start` is:

1. _index.html_ from the `public` folder is loaded. It renders a single &lt;div&gt; that is the container for the rest of the app. Webpack slighly modifies this file so that it also loads:
2. `src/index.tsx`. This will render the &lt;App&gt; component, which for us, lives in `src/containers/App/index.tsx`. But first:
3. Babel will convert it from `.jsx` to plain `.js` first, so the friendly-looking &lt;App&gt; becomes a DOM command like `React.createElement('DIV', etc. etc.)`.
4. Rinse and repeat for all the components under &lt;App&gt;.

## React Routing

React Routing is used throughout for defining 'pages' and generating links to them. It takes advantage of &lt;NavLink&gt;'s ability to style the currently selected link.

## CSS modules

React CSS modules are used to namespace the CSS and prevent any component's styles from polluting the styles of others. CSS files become modules when you name them `xxxx.module.css`. See the code for the convention of declaring and referencing your styles.

When you view the source, you will notice that the css class names and id's have been decorated with additional characters. Example: `App_link__xYAAD`.

## CSS classnames package

The [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) package is in use in the `Paginated, Tabular Data` demo.

## Helmet

`react-helmet-async` solves the inherent problem of SPAs where all 'pages' inherit the HTML &lt;title&gt; of the main App. Helmet allows you to set the title for each component individually. You would want to have a &lt;Helmet&gt; element for a component that has a route assigned to it, not to components instantiated by composition.

The original `react-helmet` is buggy.

## Naming convention for components

1. Files and file folders should be all lower case with hyphens, ie "my-widget/my-widget.tsx". Some environments are case sensitive and this also prevents casing errors and makes imports from NPM more consistent
2. Function components should be pascal case, ie "MyWidget"
3. Methods should be camelCase and be named for this function, ie "addNumbers"
4. Function filenames should match the folder filename, ie "my-widget/my-widget.tsx". This makes it easy to look up files via file search and also prevents having hundreds of "index.tsx" in the project which are indistinguishable

## Context API

(1) Create `StarterContext.tsx` (src/containers/App)

(2) In the App container, import it: `import { StarterProvider } from './StarterContext'

(3) In App's return value, wrap the HTML output with &lt;StarterContext&lt;:

```
    <Router>
       ...other stuff here...
          <StarterProvider>
             ...your HTML here...
          </StarterProvider>
       ...
    </Router>
```

(4) Repeat sep 2 for each component that needs the provider

(5) In each component retrieve the item you need: `  const { HTMLtitlePre } = useContext(StarterContext)`

Context API is simpler and lighter weight than Redux for sharing read-only contents.

## Passing styles to a component via props

The `Shared data via Context API` demonstrates this.

## REST service call with fetch()

This is now part of the `Shared data via Context API` demo.

## React Hooks

All components and containers are function based, so any of them can support hooks.

The `Shared data via Context API` demo uses the `useEffect()` and `useState()` hooks.

## Container/Component composition

&lt;App&gt; and &lt;ContextDemo&gt; are designated as _Containers_ because they compose _Components_ inside them.

## Form Validation

The library used for this demo is `react-hook-form`.

## Form Validation with Formik and Yup

The same app above, written for the [Formik](https://formik.org/) library with [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) validation.

## Paginated, Tabular Data

This example uses [material-react-table](https://www.material-react-table.com/) which is in
turn based on [material-ui (a.k.a. MUI)](https://mui.com/). The packages added to `Dependencies` are:

> @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, material-react-table

## favicon

An favicon as added, look for it in your browser tabs.

The approach was to take a small logo and pass it to the online [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/). The images it produced
were all copied into `public`, they are:

> android-chrome-192x192.png, favicon.ico, android-chrome-512x512.png, index.html, apple-touch-icon.png manifest.json
> favicon-16x16.png, favicon-32x32.png

...and these lines were added to `public/index.html`:

```
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <LINK REL="SHORTCUT ICON" HREF="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico?v=2" type="image/x-icon" />

```

## Redux

This demo uses the [hooks version of Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks).

The packages added are:

> react-redux, react-router-dom, redux, redux-thunk

The definition of the state we are managing in Redux resides in `src/redux`. For further information, try [Getting Started with Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started).

The top level `App` component needs to be wrapped with &lt;Provider&gt;:

```
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
    import store from './redux/store'
    ...
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
```

Clients who need to read the Redux state:

```
  import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
  ...
  const ourStore = useSelector(state => state.ourReducer)
  const { ourValue }= ourStore.state
```

Clients who need to write the state:

```
  import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
  import { setGlobalState } from '../../redux/actions'
  ...
  const dispatch = useDispatch()
  const valueToSet = 'foo'
  dispatch(setGlobalState({ state: { ourValue: valueToSet } }))
```

The names _setGlobalState_, _state_, _ourStore_, _ourValue_, etc. are all arbitrary and should be selected according to the meaning they have in your app.

## Misc Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It has not been ejected (read about ejecting [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject)).
One of the usual reasons for ejecting is to when a new feature requires a change
to the webpack configuration. But alternatives to ejecting should be explored first.
